    <p>
      Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew
      probably aren’t thinking about its health benefits or risks. And yet this
      beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In 1991 coffee was
      included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health
      Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research found that the
      beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the
      contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who
      drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly accounted for.
      Additional accumulating research suggests that when consumed in
      moderation, coffee can be considered a healthy beverage. Why then in 2018
      did one U.S. state pass legislation that coffee must bear a cancer warning
      label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee.
